Guitar Chords Recognition (Renner Lucena)
This project tries to recognise the guitar chords based on sound input, so that Renner does not have to scroll the screen manually while playing one. I found this particularly interesting as I myself am a guitar player and have faced similar situations. Moreover, there can be another use case where we can tune the guitar using this project too.

AskMD - A Knowledge System (David J. Longo)
This project talks about the application of Artificial Intelligence in the medical domain, particularly learning information from corpus and answering biological and clinical questions. I believe this project is really helpful moving forward, as this would help providing quick and real time diagnosis to patients.

PUBG Finish Placement Prediction Challenge (Apoorv Chaudhary)
Personally, being a frequent PUBG player pulled me towards this poster. Being able to predict what position I'll come in the next game seems very cool, particularly when playing with bunch of friends. I see that Apoorv is able to get a bery low mean absolute error and close to that of the leaderboard, which makes me believe that finish placements are predictable.
